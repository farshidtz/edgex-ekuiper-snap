# EdgeX eKuiper Snap

eKuiper is a lightweight IoT edge analytics software.

This is a snap packaging of eKuiper tailored to the EdgeX Foundry snap,
available at: https://snapcraft.io/edgexfoundry

The snap is designed to work with EdgeX and is not supported 
for standalone use.

The snap is **NOT SUPPORTED** by the eKuiper community.
For any EdgeX-related issues when using this snap, please refer to:

## Snap Installation
[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-ekuiper)

### Install and configure dependencies
EdgeX eKuiper works together with few other EdgeX services.

The snap is configured to get a vault token from [edgexfoundry Snap](https://snapcraft.io/edgexfoundry). 
Since `2.2.0-dev.32`, a token is automatically generated for edgex-ekuiper; see [PR #3888](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go/pull/3888). This is currently available in `latest/beta`. For versions prior to this, the edgex-ekuiper token can be added by configuration. Please refer to edgexfoundry Snap's docs for details.

The default configuration expects that events are filtered by app-service-configurable and published to the EdgeX message bus. **This behavior may change in future.** To enable the expected [filtering](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.2/microservices/application/AppServiceConfigurable) using the [app-service-configurable snap](https://snapcraft.io/edgex-app-service-configurable), install and set the profile as follows:

```bash
sudo snap install edgex-app-service-configurable
sudo snap set edgex-app-service-configurable profile=rules-engine
sudo snap start --enable edgex-app-service-configurable
```

The default setup described above will prepare the system such that:
- edgex-ekuiper and edgex-app-service-configurable are active and enabled
- edgexfoundry.kuiper and edgexfoundry.app-service-configurable are inactive and disabled - we do not need them
- edgexfoundry's vault and redis, along with other core services are active and enabled

Verify that by executing the following command:
```bash
$ sudo snap services edgex-ekuiper edgex-app-service-configurable edgexfoundry

To change the default configuration, refer below.

## Snap Configuration
The service starts by default, and can be restarted as follows. 
It will pick up any change made to config files:
```bash
sudo snap restart edgex-ekuiper.kuiper
```
The service can be stopped as follows. The `--disable` option
ensures that as well as stopping the service now, 
it will not be automatically started on boot:
```bash
sudo snap stop --disable edgex-ekuiper.kuiper
```
The service can be started as follows. 
The `--enable` option ensures that as well as starting the service now, 
it will be automatically started on boot:
```bash
sudo snap start --enable edgex-ekuiper.kuiper
```
### Configuration files
The basic configuration file for eKuiper is at `/var/snap/edgex-ekuiper/current/etc/kuiper.yaml`.
For more details, please refer to [lf-edge/ekuiper docs](https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper/blob/master/docs/en_US/operation/config/configuration_file.md).

The `/var/snap/edgex-ekuiper/current/etc` directory contains all the configuration files of eKuiper.
These include configurations such as for sources, sinks, and connections.

### Connect to edgexfoundry secure message bus
By default, this snap enables its service on install, edgexfoundry has security turned on. 
ekuiper will get edgexfoundry's secret automatically.

If edgexfoundry is not ready yet, 
then there will be no secret file coming from edgexfoundry under `/var/snap/edgex-ekuiper/current/edgex-ekuiper/secrets-token.json`.
In this case,  eKuiper will restart to search authentication periodically. 

### Work without edgex-app-service-configurable filtering:
```bash
sudo snap stop edgex-app-service-configurable
```
Modify eKuiper's config files:
```bash
# Change sources' `topic` from edgex-app-service-configurable to edgexfoundry message bus:
sudo nano /var/snap/edgex-ekuiper/current/etc/sources/edgex.yaml
# change: 
topic: rules-events
# to:
topic: edgex/events/#
# Change sources' `messageType` from event (default) to request:
sudo nano /var/snap/edgex-ekuiper/current/etc/sources/edgex.yaml
# add:
default:
	messageType: request
```
Pick up any changes made to config files:
```bash
sudo snap restart edgex-ekuiper
```
### Viewing logs
To view the logs for the service in the edgex-ekuiper snap:
```
sudo snap logs -f edgex-ekuiper.kuiper
```
## Tagging
This repository is tagged after the eKuiper project with a [semver build metadata](https://semver.org/#spec-item-10) `snap` suffix.
For example, if eKuiper is tagged as `1.4.3`, this repository will be tagged as `1.4.3+snap`, `1.4.3+snap.2`, `1.4.3+snap.N`. The build version increments indicate updates to the snap packaging on top of the same eKuiper release.

The [release](https://github.com/canonical/edgex-ekuiper-snap/actions/workflows/release.yml) Github workflow can be used to manually tag and release, enforcing the above schema.
